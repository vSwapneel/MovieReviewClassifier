# MovieReviewClassifier

Task is to infer sentiment (or polarity) from free form review text submitted for movies and to predict the sentiment for 25000 reviews for movies provided in the test file (test.txt). Positive sentiment is represented by a +1 review rating, and Negative Sentiment is represented by a review rating of -1. In test.txt we only have the reviews but no ground truth rating.s

Training data consists of 25000 reviews as well and exists in file train.dat. Each row begins with the sentiment score followed with a text of the rating.


For both training and test data, each review ends with #EOF to denote the end of review.
